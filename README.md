# Wildlife Trap Camera

## Introduction

This project builds on top the great work of [NatureWatchCameraServer](https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/NaturewatchCameraServer).

Due to increasing deforestation, loss of biodiversity and climate change, monitoring of wildlife and their habitat is becoming increasingly important. This project aims to build a low-cost wildlife trap camera that can be deployed in the wild to monitor wildlife activity. This project will also include a notification system, to give an early notice for any illegal lumber activity, as there are tree species in threat of extinction that are highly prized for their wood, these trees are of high importance to the habitat, and losing them would endanger these special ecosystems.

The aim is to collect as many data points.
